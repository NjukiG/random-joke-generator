RANDOM JOKES GENERATOR:

Project Author - George Njuki.

This project is part of my bootcamp prerequisites to graduate.

It is a single page random jokes generator to keep you laughing and give you that quick dopamine kick you need to keep your day going with a smile.

The program uses an API from JokeAPI Documentation that provides a link to multiple categories of jokes.

This program uses he categories of programming, dark, pun and spooky jokes, without limiting/flagging jokes on workplace, religion, political or even explicit nature. No limitations were made to this app.

The app uses HTML for structure, CSS for styling and Vanilla JavaScript for the functionality. No frameworks, libraries or design tools were used in making this app.

How does it work, you ask?

Simple.

You just load it up on your browser and click the button to generate jokes randomly on the container.
By cicking the button, a new joke is generated and the background-color of the container changes simultaneously with each new joke generated. That was actually the functionality that made me enjoy building this project.

I also made sure that the app was responsive to different viewport sizes such as desktop and mobile too. A media query had to be used for that.

The link to the API is: https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Programming,Miscellaneous,Dark,Pun,Spooky?type=twopart&amount=10

When using the app, limit your clicks to 60 a day. If your exceed the number of jokes a day, the app will stop functionality and have to be patient to try it out the following day.
